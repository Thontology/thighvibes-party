## Why an NSFW Fork?

The original project, [Super-Agent-Party](https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party), was designed as a **general-purpose 3D AI desktop companion**.  
**ThighVibes Party** takes the same powerful foundation and adapts it specifically for **adult use cases**:  

- 🔥 Explicit roleplay and adult Tavern cards  
- 🔥 Integration with NSFW media (memes, packs, streams)  
- 🔥 Device support (interactive toys and smart-home kink setups)  
- 🔥 A sandboxed but open platform for erotic AI experimentation  

This fork is built to be **playful, intimate, and uncensored**, while preserving all the modular extensibility of the parent project.
